## Hold me accountable!

I will set aside 3 hours every day for a week to work on this challenge. I will keep myself accountable by completing a challenge a day. My reward for completing this DevOps challenge will be the joy and achievement of learning new skills.

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is is a set of practices that combines development (writing code) and operations (deploying and maintaining code) to shorten development cycles and deliver reliable software and DevOps engineers implement  DevOps practices in their organization .

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). It's an automated approach to software development where code changes are regularly integrated, tested, and deployed to production with minimal manual intervention.
This process helps teams by catching bugs earlier, accelerating delivery time, and reducing deployment risks. It enables faster releases, improves collaboration, and ensures software can be reliably deployed at any time.
