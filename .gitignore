Ah, got it! You want to keep the main README.md (the one outside) but remove the ones inside each project folder.
Update your .gitignore to this:
bash# Image folders
screenshots/
images/

# PDF files
*.pdf

# PEM files (private keys - IMPORTANT for security!)
*.pem

# README files inside project folders only
